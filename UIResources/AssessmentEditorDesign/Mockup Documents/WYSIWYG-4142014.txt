3 Main Scenarios
------------------------------------

1. Edit Scenario
-------------------------------------
- Change the way a Battery is set up for users (veterans).
- Admin user does one of two things
	= System-wide, OEF/OIF Battery, make changes that scale down through all instances of Battery in use
	= Go in, open up Battery, delete Module, or make edit changes (top-level)
	= Make additional adjustments (page order, question order, add/edit Questions, etc.) - path to Module
	= Access to all aspects of the Battery (i.e., Templates, Formulas, Rules, Questions, Sections, etc.)
	= Must remain in-context, path back to the Batter for sub-tasks
- Probably not desirable to allow out-of-context changes (no flattened navigation, aside from Batteries, Modules
- Ability to clone as later enhancement
- In-use Batteries would require creating new Modules when changing scoring, etc.
- ** Not only Delete, Add Module, Associated Questions, rules, scoring, etc.
- Adding and Removing Modules (Delete is different) are the primary tasks, all other tasks secondary, but navigable


2. Build Battery for Specific Single-Use (i.e., specific Veteran)
--------------------------------------
- Build for a clinician for specific user (ex., OEF/OIF Clinician)
- If possible, start with a clone (only if in scope) of existing Battery 
   (a direct copy, but must be customized)
- Otherwise, build it from scratch.

3. New Program requires eScreening
---------------------------------------
	= Provide own Battery (with all of the necessary definitions/objects)
- Would define Questions, etc.  Example: Activities of Daily Living
- Program would provide basic rules, formulas, required (follow basic Question Types)
- Create Modules on the basis of the Program's definitions
- Unless there is a need to override (no ability to clone), if Questions are pre-defined,
	would like to use existing (makes sense).
- Battery creations, select and add new Modules, drag in existing Modules (accessibility determined
	by facility/location?)


Annotations:

- Most use cases will not require heavy work in the other areas, but functionality should be present
	and available.
- Sections would be in the context of Battery.
- Templates in Battery (i.e., Clinical Note {associated by Module}, Completion Message, Summary).  
	Modules, Summary optional
- Modules:
	= Module Title would default as Section Name to Veteran, as well as visible to Battery Build
	= Description, Title
	= Add Questions
	= Set up Scoring (formulas, rules, conditional events)
	= Associate Rules, Events (Map Variables), specify actions for each scoring case
		(determines Summary text, health factor-based, dependent on score)
	= Templates would be logical last step
	= Dashboard Events
	= Health Factors as associable
	= Next step is Battery Add/Edit - Add Module
	= Determine order (sortability)
	= Provide downstream edits through all sub-flows
	= Preview Pane as top-level (tabbed?)
	= Might also require top-level editing of Templates (possible third direct Navigation option,
		with full access to the Template types).
