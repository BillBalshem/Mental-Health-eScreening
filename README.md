Mental Health eScreening - Project 20388

The Mental Healh eScreening (MHE) project is designed to give the VA OEF/OIF, mental health, and primary care communities the ability to automate collection and scoring of screening instruments in order to improve efficiency in treating patients.

The MHE application will accelerate the process for enrolling patients into mental health care. This effort will create and deploy a web-based intake form for completing mental health assessments to be used for returning Operation Enduring Free/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans. MHE will allow clinicians to perform patient-directed screening, real-time scoring and chart note generation, and individualized patient feedback. The application offers VA the option to administer eScreening assessments remotely as it will have the ability to store offline data. MHE will provide a real-time push of clinical information to the VA electronic medical records system, and real-time alert to clinicians for evaluation and triage. The MHE application was developed with funding from the 2010 Employee Innovations Competition. 

You can bootstrap the application with the `install.sh` script like this:

```bash
% sh install.sh
```
