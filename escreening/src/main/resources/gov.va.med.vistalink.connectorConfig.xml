	<!--  
	The basic settings for each <connector> entry are as follows:
	
	jndiName (required): Uniquely identifies each entry. Should be the same JNDI name as you will specify in the weblogic-ra.xml descriptor for your connector. This setting is also used to create the JNDI half of the mappings between station numbers and connector JNDI names. 
 	NOTE: The value must start with an alphanumeric character, and following that can contain only alphanumeric plus the following punctuation characters: - _ / ( ) [ ]
	
	primaryStation (required): Station number of the M/Kernel system connected to. VistALink’s institution mapping functionality maps this station number to the connector's JNDI name, so the application can retrieve the connector by the station number. This entry is checked against the DEFAULT INSTITUTION field (#217) of the KERNEL SYSTEM PARAMETERS file (#8989.3) at runtime, when connections are made. 

	ip (required): IP address of the M VistALink listener to connect to (either numeric or mnemonic).

	port (required): Port of the M VistALink listener to connect to.

	access-code and verify-code (required): The access and verify code credentials for the connector proxy user to connect to the M VistALink listener.
 	NOTE: When entering access and verify codes directly in the config file (not using the configuration editor), if the codes contain the following special characters, they need to be entered as follows:

		special char    enter as
		    <           &lt;
		    &           &amp;
		    "           &quot;
		    '           &apos;
		or alternatively, use the configuration editor.

	encrypted (optional): true | false. When the access/verify codes are encrypted by VistALink, this attribute is set to true. If you need to manually (outside the configuration editor) update the access / verify code, however, set "encrypted" to false so that VistALink will know the access/verify code is not encrypted.

	enabled (required): true | false. If false, the connector will not deploy. Use this attribute primarily to retain inactive configurations in your configuration file.

	timeout (optional): Sets the default span of time in seconds socket will wait for response from M (e.g., waiting for an RPC to execute) and after which connection is automatically terminated.

	always-use-default-as-min: If true, the default timeout will be the lowest timeout value allowed for this connector; it will override any programmatically specified lower value set by an application.
	timestamp: When a connector entry is edited, the configuration editor automatically stamps the entry with a timestamp.
